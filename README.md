## ðŸš€ About Me

I am Sharan Murli, a recent graduate with a Master's in Computer Science from the University of Southern California (USC). My love for coding and software development allows me to express my creativity and brings to life innovative solutions to real-world problems. With over one and a half years of internship experience, beginning in my third year of undergraduate studies, I have honed my skills in web development, software development, UI/UX design, and full-stack development. Along with my early internships, I have gained valuable experience as a Software and IT Analyst at USC Marshall School of Business and as a Software Engineering Intern at WorkUp. I have also worked on AI and LLM-based projects, further broadening my expertise in cutting-edge technologies.es.

## ðŸŒŸ Current Interests

I am particularly passionate about Full Stack development and Machine Learning. My interest lies in designing intuitive user interfaces and developing robust backend systems that enhance user experience. Additionally, I am fascinated by the potential of machine learning to solve complex problems and create smarter applications. I look forward to leveraging my skills and knowledge in these areas to build innovative solutions that drive positive change.

## âš½ My Passion

But there's more to me than just coding. I am an avid sports fan, and I have represented my school in district-level football. For me, football is more than just a game. It's a passion that has been burning inside me since I was a child. The thrill of the competition, the rush of adrenaline, the satisfaction of scoring a goal - it's what keeps me coming back for more. When I'm not on the field, I'm studying the game, analyzing strategies, and honing my skills. Whether I'm playing in a competitive match or just kicking the ball around with friends, football is an essential part of who I am. 

As a passionate software developer and football player, I have come to appreciate the similarities between coding and sports. Both require discipline, patience, and the ability to think on your feet.
